## 📝 Recommendations

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Set Environment Variables** in your hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.):
   ```bash
   GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY=your_ghl_api_key_here
   FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_facebook_access_token
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id
   IP_GEOLOCATION_API_KEY=your_ipgeolocation_key
   GOHIGHLEVEL_CALENDAR_ID=your_calendar_id
   ```

2. **Test with Real Credentials** using the test suite:
   ```bash
   BASE_URL=https://your-production-url.com node test-apis.js
   ```

3. **Monitor in Production:**
   - Check GHL for new contacts with correct tags
   - Check Facebook Events Manager for Lead events
   - Verify event match quality score in Facebook

4. **Verify Tags in GHL:**
   - Login to GoHighLevel
   - Go to Contacts
   - Check that new leads have: `website-lead`, `XENON BPD`, `qualified`
   - Verify qualification notes are attached
